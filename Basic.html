Context API (optional)

AuthContext.js for global user state‡•§

Login/Signup state share across components‡•§

API Integration

fetchEvents(), createEvent(), deleteEvent()

Async/Await, Try/Catch for error handling‡•§

Handling HTTP Status Codes (200, 201, 204, 403, 404, 500)

Immutability

State update: setEvents([...prev, newEvent])

Filter on delete: setEvents(prev.filter(...))

Feedback Messages

Success/Failure alerts (Event created, deleted)

Password strength indicator (Weak/Medium/Strong)

  React Topics Covered in EventSphere
React Topic	Usage in Project	Coverage % (Approx.)	Explanation
Components	EventCard, EventForm, Navbar, ProtectedRoute, pages	100%	Every feature is modularized in components.
Props	Parent ‚Üí Child data passing (EventCard, EventForm)	100%	Fully utilized for reusability and function passing.
State (useState)	Form inputs, event list, loading/error	90%	Almost all dynamic data managed via state.
Effect (useEffect)	API fetch on mount (EventTest)	80%	Used for async data fetching, could be extended for more events.
Conditional Rendering	Navbar links, loading/error messages, admin-only pages	95%	Well covered using if, ternary, && logic.
Event Handling	Button clicks, form submission, delete events	100%	Fully implemented.
Routing (React Router)	Page navigation, ProtectedRoute, Navigate	90%	Covers most routes, could add nested routes for more depth.
Context API	AuthContext for user state	50%	Used, but not heavily. Mostly login/signup state.
Two-way Binding	Form inputs ‚Üî state	100%	Fully implemented in forms.
API Integration	fetch/create/delete events	100%	Async/await with error handling implemented.
Immutability	State update (spread operator, filter)	100%	Proper immutable updates everywhere.
Styling	Inline styles	30%	Only basic styling, no CSS framework used.
Overall Coverage Estimate

Core React Concepts (Components, Props, State, Event Handling, Routing, Conditional Rendering, API calls, Immutability) ‚Üí ~90% covered

Advanced/Optional React Features (Context API, Hooks beyond useState/useEffect, Styling frameworks, Performance optimization) ‚Üí partially covered ‚Üí ~50% covered
